3.	How to achieve deep copy in case of nested objects?
4.	Database queries for joins?
5.	Coding Challenge | input – 12345 | Output – sum(15) | Approach – Recursive

Coding as per Below =>

Inner Join // Common between both

Select column_name from Orders o INNER JOIN  Customer c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID where ; 

Left Join
Select CustomerName,ContactName from Orders o LEFT JOIN  Customer c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID where ;


Right Join
Select CustomerName,ContactName from Orders o RIGHT JOIN  Customer c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID where ;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// var num = 12345
// output : 15

// Recursive Approach

function sum(num){
    let newArr = [num];
    let arr = newArr.forEach((a)=>{
        console.log(a);
    })
    console.log(newArr);
    // if(num <= 1){
    //     return 1;
    // }
    // return sum(num) + sum(num-1);
}

var num = 12345;
console.log(sum(num));

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// function sayHello(callback){
//     callback();
//     console.log("I am hello function");
// }

// function callback(){
//     console.log("I am callback function");
// }

// sayHello(callback);

// const sayHello = new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
//     // resolve("Hello");
//     reject("Error has occured");
// })

// sayHello.then((data)=> console.log(data)).catch((err)=>console.log(err));

// Async and await

// const sayHello = async() =>{
//     await showDB();
// }

// sayHello();

// Shallow Reference
// Deep copy | Value should copy not reference
// let a = 10;
// let b = a;
// b = 20;
// console.log(a,b);

// Spread opeartor, 
let a = {
    name:"abc",
    address:{
        city:"Pune"
    }
}

let b = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(a));

b.address['city'] = 'Mumbai';

console.log(a);
console.log(b);
